# GraphQL Error Handling

GraphQL error handling is a fundamental aspect of
building reliable APIs. In this guide we will explore
GraphQL's approaches to error handling.

## Top-Level Errors

A top-level error prevents an operation from executing
and can affect multiple fields at once. These appear
in the top-most `:error` field alongside `:data` in
the GraphQL response.

## User Errors

User errors are predictable, application-specific errors
from validation or business logic failures. They appear
in the `data` object, providing a standardized way for
clients to receive resolved data alongside errors.

## Query vs Mutation Errors

Queries and mutations handle errors differently, meaning
the same error can appear differently depending on the
operation.

Queries retrieve structured data. If a query fails, it
either returns nil with an error in the "errors" array or
only affects specific fields, leaving others resolvable.
Unlike mutations, queries donâ€™t structure business logic
errors inside data, so they go in the top-most "errors".

```elixir
query {
user(id: 1) {
    id
    email
}
}

%{
data: %{"user" => nil},
errors: [
    %{
    "message" => "You do not have permission to access this resource.",
    "extensions" => %{
        "code" => "FORBIDDEN",
        "id" => 1
    }
    }
]
}
```

Here, the query fails due to a business rule, returning
`nil` for user and adding an error to the errors array.

In mutations, business logic errors go inside the mutation
payload (e.g., userErrors) instead of as top-level errors.
Since mutations allow partial execution, some parts can
succeed while others fail.

```elixir
mutation {
updateUser(input: %{"id" => "1", "email" => "alice@example.com"}) {
    users {
    id
    email
    }
    userErrors {
    message
    field
    }
}
}

%{
data: %{
    "updateUser" => %{
    "user" => nil,
    "userErrors" => %{
        "message" => "You do not have permission to access this resource.",
        "field" => ["input", "id"]
    }
    }
}
}
```

Here, a user tries to update `id: 1` but lacks permission.
Since mutations define their own response, the error
appears in `userErrors` instead of blocking execution.

Now, consider a case where multiple users are updated,
and some succeed while others fail:

```elixir
mutation {
updateUsers(input: [
    %{"id" => "1", "email" => "alice@example.com"},
    %{"id" => "2", "email" => "invalid-email"},
    %{"id" => "3", "email" => "bob@example.com"}
]) {
    users {
    id
    email
    }
    userErrors {
    message
    field
    }
}
}

%{
data: %{
    "updateUsers" => [
    %{
        "users" => [
        %{"id" => "1", "email" => "alice@example.com"},
        nil,
        %{"id" => "3", "email" => "bob@example.com"}
        ],
        "userErrors" => [
        %{
            "message" => "You do not have permission to access this resource.",
            "field" => ["input", "users", "id"]
        }
        ]
    }
    ]
}
}
```

Here, a user tries to update three users, but one has an
invalid email. The mutation executes partially, updating
two users successfully and returning an error in
`userErrors` for the failed update.

In summary:

- GraphQL allows partial responses where some fields can
resolve while others fail.

- Mutations allow partial execution, attaching user errors
to the failed parts.

- Queries return `nil` for business logic errors (e.g.
data-validation and authorization failures) and place
them in the "errors" array.
